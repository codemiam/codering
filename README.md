# Codering

**Codering** is an automated, scalable, distributed web stack, powering an educational platform focused towards _learning how to code_.

It consists of a full-fledged platform made of loosely-coupled services that anyone can deploy on a single server, or better, a Kubernetes cluster.

The platform is _fully open-source_, featuring:

- a lightweight, reactive, allegedly nice-looking client app
- a highly-performant, distributed FaaS

Check [IDEAS.md](./IDEAS.md) (fr) for the initial vision.
